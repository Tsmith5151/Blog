## About

I recently earned my Master's degree in Petroleum Engineering from Louisiana State University in Petroleum Engineering (2015). My research focued on modeling hydraulically fracutred wells in tight unconventional shale plays utilizing numerical simulations  In 2013, I earned my B.S. degree in Petroleum Engineering at LSU as well. I recently completed a Nanodegree in Machine Learning through <a href="https://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a> and will be pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science this Fall 2016 semester. Additionally, I have had the unique opportunity to work multiple summer internships with several different companies ranging from one of the industries leading oilfield service companies, to a small privately operated Exploration and Production operating company, and with several Mechanical Engineering Consulting firms. However, through my professional experience and academic background, my career ambitions are focused in Data Analytics and Machine Learning. 

I recently worked on developing a methodology for predicting of oil and gas production through factor analysis and classification and regression tress in unconventional shale reservoirs as part of my R&D internship with Landmark Software. The objective of this work is to utilize multivariate statistical analysis for predicting oil and gas production of a prospective exploratory well. As a result of team's our work, a technical paper was submitted and accepted to the Unconventional Resources Technology Conference to be held in San Antonio, Texas in August 2016. If permission is granted, I will discuss more on the R&D work in greater detail in a later blog. In the meantime, the initial blog postings in large part will cover the Machine Learning projects completed through Udacity's MLND program.
